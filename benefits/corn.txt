It also feeds healthy bacteria in your digestive tract, which may help protect against colon cancer.

Yellow corn is a good source of the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin, which are good for eye health and help prevent the lens damage that leads to cataracts. 
Corn also has smaller amounts of vitamins B, E, and K, along with minerals like magnesium and potassium.
