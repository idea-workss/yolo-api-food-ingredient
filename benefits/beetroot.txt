Beetroot (Beta vulgaris) is a root vegetable also known as red beet, table beet, garden beet, or just beet. 
Packed with essential nutrients, beetroots are a great source of fiber, folate (vitamin B9), manganese, potassium, iron, and vitamin C. 
Beetroots and beetroot juice have been associated with numerous health benefits, including improved blood flow, lower blood pressure, and increased exercise performance. 
Many of these benefits are due to their high content of inorganic nitrates.
