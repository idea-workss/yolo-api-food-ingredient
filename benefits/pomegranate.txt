Pomegranates have been eaten throughout history for their health benefits. Nowadays, the juice of this fruit is a popular part of healthy diets.

Pomegranate seeds get their vibrant red hue from polyphenols. These chemicals are powerful antioxidants.

Pomegranate juice contains higher levels of antioxidants than most other fruit juices. It also has three times more antioxidants than red wine and green tea. The antioxidants in pomegranate juice can help remove free radicals, protect cells from damage, and reduce inflammation.

Not only antioxidants, the juice of a single pomegranate has more than 40 percent of your daily requirement of vitamin C.

In addition to vitamin C, pomegranate juice is a good source of folate, potassium, vitamin E, and vitamin K.
